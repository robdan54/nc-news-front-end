## Description

A front end web project to display articles and comments on those articles. The application was designed to implement the following user stories

- Users should be able to
  - view a list of all articles
  - view an individual article
  - filter the list of articles by topic
  - sort the list of articles both ascending and descending
  - vote on an article
  - view a list of comments on an article
  - post a comment on an existing article
  - delete a comment they have posted

The web page was designed with a mobile first design ethos. Users can add and comments to articles with use of optimistic rendering. Some of the web pages in the navigation bar have not yet been implemented and are there to demonstrate routing.
